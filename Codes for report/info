# The main file sd_shell.py computes the energy levels for a certain number of valence nucleons and total M-value, given as input. 
# For the comparison to work with NushellX and experimental data, 
# only even number of valence neutrons is accepted and only M=0 is valid, since the lowest level is shifted to zero.

# The file sd_shell_drip.py plots the two-neutron separation energies for oxygen isotopes.
