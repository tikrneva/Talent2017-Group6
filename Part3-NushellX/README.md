# PART 3: NUSHELLX CALCULATIONS

### Task 1: Test your effective interaction and setup of single-particle energies by computing the spectra of 18O and 18F (USDA and USDB, compare to experiments)
This is just a NushellX run for two different nuclei and two different interaction. Two spectra are shown in the  following figures (the other two are similar).

### Task 2: Perform shell-model studies using Nushellx for all oxygen isotopes from 18O to 28O, plot the lowest-lying 3-4 states and compare with data where available
All oxygen isotopes from 18O to 28O are calculated and the level plots (in .eps format) can be found in the directory ![oxygen_isotopes](https://github.com/tikrneva/Talent2017-Group6/blob/master/Part3-NushellX/oxygen_isotopes). Also the excitation energy of the first 2 plus state for even-N oxygen isotopes is plotted.

### Task 3: Perform also shell-model studies using Nushellx for all isotopes from 18F to 29F, plot the lowest-lying 3-4 states and compare with data where available. Comment your results. Try also to compute 30F and 31F
The isotopes from 18F to 29F have been calculated and the level plots can be found in the directory ![F_isotops](https://github.com/tikrneva/Talent2017-Group6/blob/master/Part3-NushellX/F_isotops). 

Also 30F and 31F were calculated, the levels can be found in the following figures.

How to calculate 30F in nushellx? You can take 16O as a core. That means you will have 1 valence proton and 13 valence neutrons.
The goal: you want to study this system in the way that you have 1 valence proton in sd shell and 1 valence neutron in pf shell.
Like always, create a folder, e.g. "f30" (inside nushellx directory) and move into it on a command line. Then type ''shell'' 
and answer the questions in the following way.

 - name for batch file: f30
 - option: lpe
 - model space: sdpf
 - any restrictions: y
 - (s)ub-shell restrictions: m                  [Comment: m=you want to use major shells differently]
 - number of proton major shells, max 2J: 2     [Comment: you have sd and pf =2 major shells]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 1: 3, 1, 1   [Comment: you have 3 orbits is sd shell (s1/2, d5/2 and d3/2), 1proton]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 2: 4,0,0   [You assume that one proton stays in sd shell so now 0 protons, in pf shell you have 4 orbits]
 - number of proton major shells, max 2J: 2
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 1: 3, 12, 12 [sd shell full of neutrons]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 2: 4,1,1 [one neutron in pf shell]
 - interaction name: sdpfmu
 - number of protons: 9
 - number of nucleons: 30
 - min J, max J, del J : 0.0,6.0,1
 - parity: 2                                  [Comment: 1 would be enough]
 - option (lpe, den, help or st) :st
 
 and then type ". f30.bat"

### Task 4: See also if you can find excited states in 25O and 25F with negative parity
Yes, we were able to find excited states in 25O and 25F with negative parity. The results are shown in the figures "o_25m.png" and "f_25m.png". This is how you run the code for f25:

 - name for batch file: f25
 - option: lpe
 - model space: sdpf
 - any restrictions: y
 - (s)ub-shell restrictions: m                  [Comment: m=you want to use major shells differently]
 - number of proton major shells, max 2J: 2     [Comment: you have sd and pf =2 major shells]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 1: 3, 1, 1   [Comment: you have 3 orbits is sd shell (s1/2, d5/2 and d3/2), 1proton]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 2: 4,0,0   [You assume that one proton stays in sd shell so now 0 protons, in pf shell you have 4 orbits]
 - number of proton major shells, max 2J: 2
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 1: 3, 7, 8 [one hole in sd-shell is possible]
 - number of orbits, min, max in group 2: 4,0,1 [one neutron in pf shell is possible]
 - interaction name: sdpfmu
 - number of protons: 9
 - number of nucleons: 25
 - min J, max J, del J : 0.5,6.5,1
 - parity: 2                                
 - option (lpe, den, help or st) :st

### Task 5: Use the monopole interactions to calculate the energies for the ground states of the four nuclei 22âˆ’25O assuming a single Slater determinant for each. The USDB two-body matrix elements are assumed to scale like 18/A^0.3.
We solved this exercise by using NushellX. For example, the calculation of 25O was done with the following settings:

 - name for batch file: o25
 - option: lpe
 - model space: sd
 - any restrictions: y
 - (s)ub-shell restrictions: s                  [Comment: subshell restrictions wanted]
 - p1d3/2    max. no. of particles =  4 new min, max: 0,0 [No valence protons]
 - p1d5/2    max. no. of particles =  6 new min, max: 0,0 [No valence protons]
 - p2s1/2    max. no. of particles =  2 new min, max: 0,0 [No valence protons]
 - n1d3/2    max. no. of particles =  4 new min, max: 1,1 [One valence neutron on d3/2]
 - n1d5/2    max. no. of particles =  6 new min, max: 6,6 [1d5/2 full for neutrons]
 - n2s1/2    max. no. of particles =  2 new min, max: 2,2 [2s1/2 full for neutrons]
 - interaction name: usdb
 - number of protons: 8
 - number of nucleons: 25
 - min J, max J, del J : 0.5,5.5,1
 - parity: 0                                
 - option (lpe, den, help or st) :st
 
 The results were found in .lpt output file (o_25b.lpt) and they are shown in the next table.

### Task 6: Compare the results in the last problem to the full 1s0d model space results and to experiment
The energies are listed in MeVs.

| Nucleus | 1 slater | Full 1s0d | Experiment BE(Nucleus)-BE(16O)|
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
|   22O   |  -32.4   |   -34.5   | 34.4      |
|   23O   |  -35.5   |   -37.1   | 37.2      |
|   24O   |  -40.1   |   -41.2   | 41.4      |
|   25O   |  -39.3   |   -39.9   | 40.6      |

One Slater determinant describes the system surprisingly well, but in order to get closer to experimental value, one
must include more slater determinants which contribute to energies. 

### Task 7: Calculate the spectroscopic factors from the ground state of 23O to all states in 22O in the full 1s0d model space. Use the sum rule to obtain the orbital occupations in 23O for 0d5/2,1s1/2 and 0d3/2. Compare these to those given in the so-called xxx.occ file

### Task 8: Calculate the spectroscopic factors from the ground state of 23Oto all states in 24O in the full 1s0d model space. Use the sum rule to obtain the number of holes in those three orbits in 23O. Compare these to those given in the xxx.occ file.

### Task 9: Calculate the 23O 5/2(+,1) to 22O 0(+,1) spectroscopic factor. Explain why it is so small.

The most important file is called o23nb.lsf which is in /Task 9/
Also added the .ans files so people can see what needs to be input into Nushellx to calculate this.

### Task 10: Use the interaction wspot to obtain the single-particle decay width for the 23O 5/2 (+,1) state using the experimental neutron separation energy as a constraint. Combine this with the result of the last problem to obtain its neutron decay width. Compare to experiment.

### Task 11: Calculate the neutron decay width of the 25O 3/2(+,1) state and compare to experiment.  Use the experimental neutron separation energy as a constraint.

The .ans files for O24 and O25 can be found in the Task 11 subfolder (o24.ans o25.ans).

st                   ! option 

The .ans file for calculating the neutron decay is o25t1.ans.
o25ti.ans:


den                  ! option

bb0903               ! final file name (default = from lpe above)
  -1                 ! max number (-1 for all)
 0.0, 0.0, 1.0,      ! min, max J, del J for bb0802

n                    ! restrict coupling for operator
st                   ! option 

We have to limit the decay final state to the ground state of 24O as this is the only energetically allows decay according to the separation energy. 

The o25t1b.lsf file is the important output file.

### Task 12: Calculate the gamma decay of 22O for levels up to 6 MeV and compare to experiment. Calculate the B(E2) for Coulex to the 2(+,1) state in 22O and compare with experiment.

The gamma decays of 22O are shown in o_220b.deo in the Task 12 subfolder. The B(E2) is calculated to be 0.3968E+01 e^2 fm^2.

### Task 13: Calculate the magnetic moment for the 1/2(+,1) ground state of 23O and compare to the single-particle (Schmidt) value.

Added the .ans files and the .deo file with the ground-state magnetic moment of 23O. The calculated value is -1.052 mu_N. The single-particle Schmidt value for a single neutron in an s-orbit is -1.913 mu_N. Effective g-factors are often used to account for contributions of the core to the magnetic moment however this is usually not necessary in light nuclei. An experimental measurement is needed to verify this calculation.

### Task 14: Calculate the Fermi (F) and Gamow-Teller (GT) beta decay of 22O. The experimental energy of the lowest 1+ state in 22 F is 1.627 MeV. Compare the summed B(F) and B(GT) values to that expected from the sum-rules. What fraction of the GT sum-rule is in the transition to the lowest energy 1+ state?
